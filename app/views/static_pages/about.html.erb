                            <span class="anchor" id="sec1"></span>
                            <h5>Where did the idea of BimaGuide come from?</h5>
                            <p>BimaGuide as an idea came from an existing solution to a need for porter insurance. Porter, guides, and most
                               other employees surrounding the tourism industry have no way full time insurance of workers benefits. This
                               is the tourism industry in and around Kilimanjaro is highly seasonal. So workers aren't hired as full time and thus
                               don't have the benefits that full time work would normally entail (health care, dental, etc.). Not to be dettered,
                               The workers themselves banded together to create there own quasi-insurance solution. They use their own funds to
                               put together a pool that covers two major incidents: loss of a nuclear family member and broken bones (or other serious injury)
                               that occurs on the job.
                            </p>

                            <p>This solution has a couple of problems. For one, there is no transparency. The spreadsheet is kept with single control and access.
                            Tracking membership, eligibility, anc coverage also become difficult. The finances surrounding the bank account are not public
                            and don't lend themselves to validation from the community. In short, the spreadsheet solution has a trust and security problem.
                            </p>

                            <span class="anchor" id="sec2"></span>
                            <h5>How does BimaGuide attempt to solve security?</h5>
                            <p>BimaGuide tries to draw a fine line between security and convenience. It's for this reason that the construct of an Admin was created.
                            An Admin is a person (or group of up to three people). Who are elected by the community and are commited as volunteers to review claims.
                            They make a commitement to review claims in a timely manner, and will be trusted members among a fairly small community. Admins have a fair bit of responsibility, they can:
                            approve claims, modify certain configurations (claim limits, membership requirements, etc.), and flag certain members for misconduct.
                            These Admins are subject to being vetoed. If 20% of members vote for a veto, the account will be frozen, and an internal investigation will be launched.
                            If more than 50% of employees vote for a veto, the Admin is kicked out and, upon further investigation can be blacklisted and/or subject
                            to the legal ramifications of fraud. A single admin can approve claims of a medium to small size. Large claims will either require multiple admin approval and extremely large
                            claims will require a open election, where multiple admins have to approve, and a majority of members have to approve.
                            Most claims are anticipated to solely require single admin approval.
                            </p>

                            <p>Admins are held accountable through transparency and velocity. Admins are not allowed to withdraw money themselves. If Admins want to make a claim,
                            They must first abdicate, appoint a new admin, and claim as a member. Every admin action is broadcast to members, who can see a contuous feed of
                            "admin actions". Admin actions are events like modifying config environments, claim decisions (approve/deny), and claim amounts. Members can view all of these,
                            and choose to veto if neccesary. Admins are also throttled to a maximum claim amount and can only approve a maximum amount of claims in a week.
                            These numbers are derived from trying to maximize the amount corrupt people it would take to withdraw more than a $1000 dollars over
                            the span of 1 month, within 10 claims. Admins also have short terms, and need to be re-elected in the span of months, not years.
                            </p>

                            <h5>What is a Member and how do I become one?</h5>
                            <p>Membership in BimaGuide is earned through the following: a minimum amount of contributions, recent contribution, a minimum number of
                            logged jobs, and a minimum amount of votes. Members are required to actively log jobs to show continued employment, proof of work history/time of accident, and proof of contributions.
                            Members are eligible for being elected an admin, viewing all claims and admin actions, and can vote. Members hold all the power in this system and as such,
                            membership is calculated very frequently and is automated. This also combats spoofing as only members can vote and make claims. Member ship requires approval and is subject to oversight
                            by admins. As such Membership retains accessible yet secure.</p>
